About pydisplay

    http://pydisplay.sourceforge.net
    
    pydisplay is a portable library for small monochrome graphics displays.
    We support most popular controllers for graphic LCDs, VFDs, OLEDs, and ELs.
    
    'Portable' means anything that pyparallel or libusb runs on.  Pydisplay 
    is tested on Linux (SuSE, Kubuntu) and Windows XP.  It is also known to 
    run on Mac OS X but this is not supported yet.
    
    The library has a common graphics interface that is compatible with the
    Python Imaging Library. A two-layer driver model means that displays can
    be used either with the common library framework, or independently for
    direct access to the hardware interface.
    
    Displays currently supported:
    
        * Toshiba T6963C
        * Samsung KS0108 or Hitachi HD61202
        * Seiko/Epson SED1330, SED1335, or S1D13305
        * Seiko/Epson SED1520
        * Seiko/Epson SED2000 / Noritake T20A Vacuum Fluorescent Displays
        * Noritake GU3900 Vacuum Fluorescent Displays
        * Noritake GU7000 Vacuum Fluorescent Displays
        * Noritake GU-355 and 372 Vacuum Fluorescent Displays
        * Noritake GU128x32-311 Vacuum Fluorescent Display
	* Babcock GD120C280 plasma display
	* Planar EL320.240 with FTDI FT232R or FT245R USB adapter.

Setup

    For Linux:
    
        1.  Install pyparallel from:
        
                http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/pyparallel.html
    
        2.  Install Python Imaging Library (v1.1.5) from:
        
                http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
                
        3.  If you want to use the 'fast' mode for the graphics controllers,
            you'll have to install the 'ctypes' module:
        
                http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/
                
            I intend to remove this dependency soon, but not today.  The fast
            mode is always optional and will fall back to pyparallel if
            anything prevents it from loading.
    
        4.  As superuser, run:
        
                python setup.py install
    
        5.  As long as you're superuser, disconnect 'lp' from the parallel port.
            On my system this is done with:
            
                modprobe -r lp
                
            Better still would be to stop the kernel from starting lp
            automatically.  See your OS documentation about this.
    
        6.  Give yourself permission to talk to the parallel port:
        
                chmod a+rw /dev/parportN
                
            ...where N is the number of the parport you want to use, or
            just use *.
    
        7.  Each driver has a small self-test, so to try out the Noritake
            GU311 driver, type:
            
                python gu311.py
                
            ...and it will do something.
            
        8.  The expected wiring for each display is at the top of the driver
            for that display.  If you don't like the default wiring, you can
            change it, but some drivers will run in a 'fast mode' if you use
            the default wiring.
            
        9.  An RSS ticker is provided as a sample application for character-
            mode displays such as the Noritake T-series.

                python rss.py

        10. A internect clock with Google mail alert is provided as a sample 
	    application for graphical displays.
                
                python superclock

        11. Write to me if none of this works.

    For Windows:
    
        1.  Install Python 2.5
		
		http://www.python.org

	    ....if you are already running Python 2.3 or 2.4, install ctypes

	2.  Install pyparallel and giveio from:

		http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/pyparallel.html
                
            ...giveio will work without a reboot, but it will be much faster
            after you reboot.

	3.  Install Python Imaging Library (v1.1.5) from:
        
                http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

	4.  Unzip pydisplay into a directory.  Open a terminal to that
	    directory and type:

		python setup.py install

        5.  Each driver has a small self-test, so to try out the Noritake
            GU311 driver, type:
            
                python gu311.py
                
            ...and it will do something.

            for that display.  If you don't like the default wiring, you can
            change it.
